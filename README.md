# Gitting to know you
Fill in the text below with your own answers to each question. Each person in your group should submit their answers in a separate commit, but all of your answers should appear together in the file. Please add your answers after the `>` character so your answers will appear as quotes in the rendered markdown. To make it clear who has written each response, please preface each answer with your first name. For example, if Jordan writes a response to the question "What is your favorite typographical symbol?" the line should read "> Jordan: My favorite typographical symbol is the octothorp."
